# anomaly-prediction

This repo include all activities completed to construct an anomaly prediction algorithm able to detect disruptions in a fusion reactor within 30ms before disruption. The dataset used is available at the link https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/XIOHW1 in the file dataverse_files/var/www/html/reports/20JA/20JA72/20ja072_fig4_data/C_Mod_for_nn.mat


The Notebook include all activities for model selection and design, while the anomaly-detection-app folder include the app for deployment. Dependencies and requirements for the notebook are listed in requirements.txt.

The Anomaly Detection presentation is intended to present the results to an hypothetical client, not trained in Machine Learning.

The Comments on Deploy presentation presents the proposal for deployment of such system and comments potential improvements of the deployment.

The test.py is intended to test the functionality of the app.
